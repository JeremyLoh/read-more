## A randomized article finder for Android devices
## Created by Kenny Ho and Jeremy Loh

### Motivation
People tend to spend a lot of time on social media applications (e.g. Facebook) on a daily basis. According to Straits Times (2017), “Singaporeans spend an average of **12 hr 42 mins** on their digital devices”. This statistic was obtained from a study conducted by Ernst & Young on 1000 people aged 16 to 69 who have lived in Singapore for at least a year. Additionally, social media usage was ranked third among the top online activities people engaged in at least once a day. We believe that the time spent on social media applications could be better utilized on learning. Being more knowledgeable can help expand an individual’s worldview and may improve their ability to learn. Thus, we hope our application will improve the above situation mentioned.
